## Task Execution Workflow

**For every request**: Silently evaluate which skill(s) would help most. Load matching SKILL.md file(s) into context if relevant.

1. List tasks, files and what to do specifically → **Get approval**
2. Execute implementation
   - If bugs occur, loop this until resolved:
     Confirm bug details and gather info → Present bug description and propose fixes to user → **Get approval** → Execute countermeasure → Verify resolution and explain to user → **Seek further instructions from user** → Return to confirm bug

3. Run tests
   - If fails, loop this until fixed:
     Investigate and propose fixes → **Get approval** → Implement fixes → Rerun tests → Verify and explain → **Seek further instructions from user** → Return to investigate

4. Update documentation if needed
5. Lint and format code
6. Prepare commit message → **Get approval** → Commit

## Trigger Keywords

When user input contains these keywords → **STOP & REQUEST APPROVAL**

- commit, push, git add
- create, modify, delete, fix, refactor
- build, deploy

## Tools

Use **pnpm** for all package management

## Git Workflow

### Commit Format

`<type>: <description>`

**Types:** add, fix, remove, update, WIP

### Rules

- English, imperative mood (Add, Update, Fix)
- Lowercase description, no period
- Be specific and concise
